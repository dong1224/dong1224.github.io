# Recursive locking in Go is unsafe

## golang source code 

```
// There is a modified copy of this file in runtime/rwmutex.go.
// If you make any changes here, see if you should make them there.

// A RWMutex is a reader/writer mutual exclusion lock.
// The lock can be held by an arbitrary number of readers or a single writer.
// The zero value for a RWMutex is an unlocked mutex.
//
// A RWMutex must not be copied after first use.
//
// If a goroutine holds a RWMutex for reading and another goroutine might
// call Lock, no goroutine should expect to be able to acquire a read lock
// until the initial read lock is released. In particular, this prohibits
// recursive read locking. This is to ensure that the lock eventually becomes
// available; a blocked Lock call excludes new readers from acquiring the
// lock.
type RWMutex struct {
	w           Mutex  // held if there are pending writers
	writerSem   uint32 // semaphore for writers to wait for completing readers
	readerSem   uint32 // semaphore for readers to wait for completing writers
	readerCount int32  // number of pending readers
	readerWait  int32  // number of departing readers
}

const rwmutexMaxReaders = 1 << 30

// RLock locks rw for reading.
//
// It should not be used for recursive read locking; a blocked Lock
// call excludes new readers from acquiring the lock. See the
// documentation on the RWMutex type.
